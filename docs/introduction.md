# Introduction
The Counter Strike Confederation (CSC) is a different kind of Counter Strike Global Offensive experience: a persistent and evolving league designed to closely resemble and operate like a professional sports league, with General Managers who draft players, make trades, set rosters, and compete to be the powerhouse that every team strives to beat the following season. Our ultimate goal is to create a friendly environment for people to play competitive Counter Strike, regardless of their skill level.

As of right now there are four leagues: Premier, Elite, Challenger, and Prospect, with the differentiation being as close to the middle of the skill range as possible.
Improvement in players should be expected, widening the skill gap as the season progresses. Don’t be surprised to see someone a tier or two lower than their current ranks suggest!


## Definitions
- A franchise is a group of teams led by a General Manager
A tier is a group of teams, separated by skill level, who play against each other during the season.

- A team is a group of five (5) players or subset of those players within a franchise.

- A free agent is someone who can substitute on a team, or sign with a team.

- A Permanent Free Agent can substitute for a team, but not sign to a team.

- Inactive Reserve (IR) is for players who have to take extended breaks from the league

## League Roles
- A person who plays in the league is referred to in these rules as a player.

- The league is led by the 3 Admins of CSC, who primarily work with long-term decisions and projects. The league’s day-to-day activities are directed by Admins.

- The teams of the league are led by General Managers (GMs). Each GM is in charge of a grouping of teams known as a franchise. 

- Assistant GMs (AGMs) are players who are tasked with assisting their GM in various tasks. There is no requirement as to what tier they must be in.
    - AGMs can remain with a franchise if they are not playing the following season(s). Conditions: The AGM must have been involved in at least 1 season with CSC and the AGM cannot be on another franchise or a free agent.

- Captains are players who have been tasked by their GM to lead a team. There are no specific responsibilities or privileges associated with being a Captain, other than what their specific GM grants them. Captains are not permitted to see privileged information.

- Admins, General Managers (GMs), and staff members can also be players. While in an ideal world there would be separation between many of these roles, we have found that the most passionate people want to be involved in more than one way; we can attribute much of our success to this. Therefore, we permit individuals to take roles that may potentially have conflicts of interest, and build systems into the league that minimize the effect these may have on the league and maximize fairness.
    - The only exception to this rule is: GMs and AGMs may not hold the transaction manager role due to potential conflicts of interest
