# Gameplay Rules

## Game Servers
CSC Uses its own game servers for matches

Server location is set to Dallas by default, unless both teams agree upon Chicago with prior notice to Admins.

If a player has connection issues prior to all players being ready, there is an extra server available for use. This will be on a first come, first serve basis, and will be located in Dallas.

The map selection for the game will come to a veto vote where the captain of each team will switch off vetoing maps in the following format: Home, Away, Away, Home, Away, then Home will choose between the final two maps.

During playoffs, the better seeded team will choose whether they veto first or second. The order is as follows: veto-veto, pick-pick, veto-veto, with one map remaining. Each team selects their starting side on their opponent’s map pick. Map 3 is decided by a knife round.

A knife round will occur to determine which team selects the side they want to start on in the preseason, regular season, and map 3 of the playoffs.
If for any reason a server restart occurs, the outcomes of previous map veto selections, knife rounds, or side selections must be duplicated as they had been determined.

Teams MUST join/start their match server at game time, unless otherwise agreed upon for another time by the respective GMs and they have notified the League Staff in their respective transaction channels.

A forfeit counter will start at 5 minutes past the scheduled game time or the agreed upon time for any team that is late or has not shown up.
10 minutes past the scheduled game time, or the agreed upon time, the game will be forfeited. Please post in #match-check-in to have proof that the opposing team has not joined.

For Playoff matches, games beyond the first game have a break period of up to 10 minutes. If one team is not ready at that point, the team that is ready may ping the opposing captain and GM in #match-check-in. Once that ping is made, the unready team has 5 minutes to become ready. If they are still not ready, that game is forfeited by the unready team. A substitution or remake of the game will reset all of these timers.

## Cheating
### Bugs and exploits
The intentional use of any bugs, glitches, or errors in the game is forbidden. It is up to the admin’s discretion to determine whether or not the use of said bugs had an effect on the match, and whether or not to award rounds, or the match to the opposing team, or to force the match to be replayed. The usage of the following bugs is strictly forbidden, if any bug is used, which is not listed in the following list, it is at the admin’s discretion whether or not a punishment is necessary.

Examples of forbidden bugs:
- Moving through clipped areas where the movement is not intended by the design of the map is strictly forbidden (any walls, ceilings, floors etc).

- The bomb may not be planted in a location where it cannot be defused. Planting the bomb in such a way that no one can hear the beeping sound, or the planting sound is also forbidden.

- Standing on top of teammates is generally allowed, it is only forbidden, when such actions allow the player to peek over, under and/or through a solid object (e.g. wall, box, ceiling) that should not be allowed according to map design.

- Pixel walking is forbidden. A player will be considered to be pixel walking if they sit or stand on invisible pixels on the map, where there is no visible edge.

- Disrupting any map features with the use of items (e.g. stopping the train on Overpass) is not allowed.

It is recommended to check with Admins to find out whether or not a certain bug or glitch is considered legal. Admins reserve the right to make changes, even retroactively, to this list, and rule use of bugs on a case by case basis
