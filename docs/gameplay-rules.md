# Gameplay Rules

## 6.1 Match Information

**6.1.1**&emsp;For each regular season match, one game will be played. Each match will be between two teams. In the playoffs, a Best of 3 will be played.

**6.1.2**&emsp;League matches will be played on the most up-to-date patch for all game settings including any and all weapon buffs and nerfs, even if the patch takes place mid-season. This does not include an updated map pool.

**6.1.3**&emsp;League matches will only be played on maps from the current competitive rotation at the start of the season which is defined by the conclusion of the draft. These maps are:

- **6.1.3.1**&emsp;Dust 2

- **6.1.3.2**&emsp;Mirage

- **6.1.3.3**&emsp;Overpass

- **6.1.3.4**&emsp;Nuke

- **6.1.3.5**&emsp;Vertigo

- **6.1.3.6**&emsp;Inferno

- **6.1.3.7**&emsp;Ancient

**6.1.4**&emsp;If the competitive map pool changes during a CSC season, our pool will remain as is until the following season.

**6.1.5**&emsp;Games will be played with the following server settings:

**6.1.5.1**&emsp;Friendly Fire is enabled

**6.1.5.2**&emsp;Pauses during a map will consist of four 30 second tactical pauses which may be used for any reason. In addition, there will be the ability to pause for technical issues. You may not use the technical pause for more than 10 minutes cumulatively per game. You may also not use the technical pause more than 2 times per game.

**6.1.5.3**&emsp;Prior to a forfeit, the opposing team must first tell your team to unpause. This will serve as a warning. If you do not unpause within a reasonable amount of time, a forfeit will take place. If you take another technical pause after your warning you will immediately be subject to forfeit. The process to claim a forfeit win is to tell an admin in #match-check-in. It must be verified that this is what transpired. While the verification process is happening, the game must remain paused. A unanimous admin vote is required for the forfeit to be valid. If the forfeit is found invalid, the match must be played out that night or at a later date, no later than one week after the scheduled match date.

**6.1.6**&emsp;A person may be in both match team comms and spectating the active match at the same time. A spectator or coach may not talk to players during the match.

**6.1.6.1**&emsp;Evidence of a person, who is not actively playing in the match, coaching or providing any kind of competitive assistance during the game may result in a retroactive game forfeit.

**6.1.7**&emsp;If a match has a score of 15-15 at the end of regulation, it will continue into overtime

**6.1.7.1**&emsp;Overtimes will have two halves of 3 rounds (totalling 6 rounds per overtime period) until one team wins 4 out of the 6 rounds.

**6.1.7.2**&emsp;Starting money in each half of overtime will be $12,500

&emsp;

## 6.2	Game Servers

**6.2.1**&emsp;CSC uses its own game servers for matches.

**6.2.1.1**&emsp;Server location is set to Dallas by default, unless both teams agreed upon Chicago with prior notice to Admins.

**6.2.1.2**&emsp;If a player has connection issues prior to all players being ready, there is an extra server available for use. This will be on a first come, first serve basis, and will be located in Dallas.

**6.2.2**&emsp;The map selection for the game will come to a veto vote where the captain of each team will switch off vetoing maps in the following format: Team A, Team B, Team B, Team A, Team B, then Team A will choose between the final two maps.

**6.2.2.1**&emsp;The home team functions as Team A; the Away team functions as Team B.

**6.2.3**&emsp;During playoffs, the better seeded team will choose whether they veto first or second. The order is as follows: veto-veto, pick-pick, veto-veto, with one map remaining. One team selects their starting side on their opponent’s map pick. Map 3 is decided by a knife round.

**6.2.4**&emsp;A knife round will occur to determine which team selects the side they want to start on in the preseason, regular season, and map 3 of the playoffs.

**6.2.5**&emsp;If for any reason a server restart occurs, the outcomes of previous map veto selections, knife rounds, or side selections must be duplicated as they had been determined.

**6.2.6**&emsp;Teams MUST join/start their match server at game time, unless otherwise agreed upon for another time by the respective GMs and they have notified the League Staff in their respective transaction channels.

**6.2.6.1**&emsp;A forfeit counter will start at 5 minutes past the scheduled game time or the agreed upon time for any team that is late or has not shown up.

**6.2.6.2**&emsp;10 minutes past the scheduled game time, or the agreed upon time, the game will be forfeited. Please post in #match-check-in to have proof that the opposing team has not joined.

**6.2.7**&emsp;For Playoff matches, games beyond the first game have a break period of up to 10 minutes. If one team is not ready at that point, the team that is ready may ping the opposing captain and GM in #match-check-in. Once that ping is made, the unready team has 5 minutes to become ready. If they are still not ready, that game is forfeited by the unready team. A substitution or remake of the game will reset all of these timers.

&emsp;

## 6.3	Bugs and Exploits

**6.3.1**&emsp;The intentional use of any bugs, glitches, or errors in the game is forbidden. It is up to the admin’s discretion to determine whether or not the use of said bugs had an effect on the match, and whether or not he will award rounds, or the match to the opposing team, or to force the match to be replayed. The usage of the following bugs is strictly forbidden, if any bug is used, which is not listed in the following rule, it is at the admin’s discretion whether or not a punishment is necessary.

**6.3.1.1**&emsp;Examples of forbidden bugs:

- Moving through clipped areas where the movement is not intended by the design of the map is strictly forbidden (any walls, ceilings, floors etc).
- The bomb may not be planted in a location where it cannot be defused. Planting the bomb in such a way that no one can hear the beeping sound, or the planting sound is also forbidden.
- Standing on top of teammates is generally allowed, it is only forbidden, when such actions allow the player to peek over, under and/or through a solid object (e.g. wall, box, ceiling) that should not be allowed according to map design.
- Pixel walking is forbidden. A player will be considered to be pixel walking if they sit or stand on invisible pixels on the map, where there is no visible edge.
- Disrupting any map features with the use of items (e.g. stopping the train on Overpass) is not allowed.
- Abusing bugs in server configuration or plugins to cause unintended functionality or to bypass intended restrictions.
- Intentionally throwing grenades that clip through parts of the map, such as the molotov in Vertigo mid that clips through the floor to lower B.

**6.3.2**&emsp;It is recommended to check with Admins to find out whether or not a certain bug or glitch is considered legal. Admins reserve the right to make changes, even retroactively, to this list, and rule use of bugs on a case by case basis.

&emsp;

## 6.4	Disconnect Rules

**6.4.1**&emsp;If a player disconnects mid-game, they are allowed to join back as soon as possible.

**6.4.1.1**&emsp;Technical pauses, as outlined in Rule 6.1.3.2, are allowed here to give the disconnected player reasonable time to reconnect.

**6.4.2**&emsp;A team whose opponent forfeits a game may choose to decline the forfeit.

**6.4.3**&emsp;If the game was completed the round of the disconnect the stats, as recorded at the end of the game, stand.

&emsp;

## 6.5	Game Results

**6.5.1**&emsp;It is the responsibility of the GMs or Captains of both teams to report the scores for their match.

**6.5.2**&emsp;Scores should be reported in the score reporting channels for the respective tier the match was played in.

**6.5.3**&emsp;For the purposes of tiebreakers, an OT result will include 15-15 plus the last overtime scoreline. (EX: A 22-18 score will count as a 19-15 score for tiebreakers)

&emsp;

## 6.6	Additional Game Rules

**6.6.1**&emsp;Using agent skins other than the default on a given map is not allowed for CSC league matches. If a player is using a different skin, the opposing team may clearly request at any time that they unequip all agent skins for the match. The team with the offending player will then take a tech pause to resolve the issue within the next two rounds. This consumes one of the offending team's tech pauses (if no pauses are left the player must still leave and unequip all agent skins). If the team and player do not make this change after being requested, they will be subject to retroactive disciplinary actions. Regardless, the game will be played out.

**6.6.1.1**&emsp;A player that leaves the game to equip a non-default agent skin after having default skins may be subject to punishment regardless of any attempts to correct the issue.
