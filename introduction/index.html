<p>The Counter Strike Confederation (CSC) is a different kind of Counter Strike Global Offensive experience: a persistent and evolving league designed to closely resemble and operate like a professional sports league, with General Managers who draft players, make trades, set rosters, and compete to be the powerhouse that every team strives to beat the following season. Our ultimate goal is to create a friendly environment for people to play competitive Counter Strike, regardless of their skill level.</p>
<p>As of right now there are four leagues: Premier, Elite, Challenger, and Prospect, with the differentiation being as close to the middle of the skill range as possible.
Improvement in players should be expected, widening the skill gap as the season progresses. Donâ€™t be surprised to see someone a tier or two lower than their current ranks suggest!</p>
<p>Admins, General Managers (GMs), and staff members can also be players. While in an ideal world there would be separation between many of these roles, we have found that the most passionate people want to be involved in more than one way; we can attribute much of our success to this. Therefore, we permit individuals to take roles that may potentially have conflicts of interest, and build systems into the league that minimize the effect these may have on the league and maximize fairness.</p>
<p>&emsp;</p>
<h2 id="11-what-are-the-requirements-to-join">1.1 What Are the Requirements to Join?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>1.1.1</strong>&emsp;Be sportsmanlike, kind, and polite. Be mature, regardless of your age. Respect everyone, whether they are your teammates or your rivals. Be aware that your sense of humor may not be universally shared, and words and actions that may be meaningless to you could be devastating to another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>1.1.2</strong>&emsp;Joining the CSC Discord is required.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1.1.2.1</strong>&emsp;Leaving the CSC Discord is a one season ban from any events you are in, except in cases of hacked accounts or certain other issues. If you leave more than 75% into the season, you will be banned for the following season as well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>1.1.3</strong>&emsp;Sign up for CSC through the indicated signup form before the close of the signup period each season. Be sure to fully and honestly fill out the form, or you may be rejected without warning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>1.1.4</strong>&emsp;To enter the league as a rookie or PermFA, your highest ranked account reported must have, at minimum, 20 matches played on Faceit. Rookies will have roughly a week after sign ups end to complete their 20 games in order to be a part of the draft. Players that do not reach this deadline but get all 20 games before pre-season game 3 (midnight ET) will be put into the FA pool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>1.1.5</strong>&emsp;These requirements are ongoing; if you are discovered to have violated one of them, you may be removed from the league</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&emsp;</p>
<h2 id="12-important-dates-and-times">1.2 Important Dates and Times</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>1.2.1</strong>&emsp;Dates will be posted in the discord in #notices soon after the end of the past season.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>1.2.2</strong>&emsp;Combines begin at 9pm EST. Games are best of 1 and start at 10pm EST, with a scrimmage at 9pm. Playoff matches are best of 3 and start at 9pm EST.</p>
</li>
