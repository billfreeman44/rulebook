In addition, there will be the ability to pause for emergencies, technical issues and any non-tactical reason. You may not use the technical pause for more than 10 minutes cumulatively per game. You may also not use the technical pause more than 2 times per game. Handling abuses of timeouts are outlined in 6.1.5.3 6.1.5.3 \u2003Misuse of timeouts are subject to forfeit at admin discretion. This includes using technical pauses for tactical purposes and exceeding technical pause time or number limitations. Exceeding technical pause limitations require the opposing team to report the incident after first giving one warning by instructing your team to unpause in game chat. You must unpause within a reasonable amount of time and may not take any further technical timeouts. To report misuse please open a general ticket. The game shall continue and be played out if possible. Then retroactively a vote of at least all admins but one will result in a forfeit. 6.1.6 \u2003A person may be in both match team comms and spectating the active match at the same time. A spectator or coach may not talk to players during the match. 6.1.6.1 \u2003Evidence of a person, who is not actively playing in the match, coaching or providing any kind of competitive assistance during the game may result in a retroactive game forfeit. 6.1.7 \u2003If a match has a score of 15-15 at the end of regulation, it will continue into overtime 6.1.7.1 \u2003Overtimes will have two halves of 3 rounds (totalling 6 rounds per overtime period) until one team wins 4 out of the 6 rounds. 6.1.7.2 \u2003Starting money in each half of overtime will be $12,500 \u2003 6.2 Game Servers 6.2.1 \u2003CSC uses its own game servers for matches. 6.2.1.1 \u2003Server locations are Dallas and Chicago. The home team's preference, and in the case of playoffs, the higher seed's preference of server dictates which of these locations are chosen for the entire series. This preference should be communicated to the tech head. Any preference changes will take at least one match day (that the given team plays a complete game in) to go into effect unless at the start of the season. This preference is not guaranteed if there are server issues. 6.2.1.2 \u2003If a player has connection issues prior to all players being ready, there is an extra server available for use. This will be on a first come, first serve basis, and will be located in Dallas. 6.2.2 \u2003The map selection for the game will come to a veto vote where the captain of each team will switch off vetoing maps in the following format: Team A, Team B, Team B, Team A, Team B, then Team A will choose between the final two maps. 6.2.2.1 \u2003The home team functions as Team A; the Away team functions as Team B. 6.2.3 \u2003During playoffs, the better seeded team will choose whether they veto first or second. The order is as follows: veto-veto, pick-pick, veto-veto, with one map remaining. One team selects their starting side on their opponent\u2019s map pick. Map 3 is decided by a knife round. 6.2.4 \u2003A knife round will occur to determine which team selects the side they want to start on in the preseason, regular season, and map 3 of the playoffs. 6.2.5 \u2003If for any reason a server restart occurs, the outcomes of previous map veto selections, knife rounds, or side selections must be duplicated as they had been determined. 6.2.6 \u2003Teams MUST join/start their match server at game time, unless otherwise agreed upon for another time by the respective GMs and they have notified the League Staff in their respective transaction channels. 6.2.6.1 \u2003A forfeit counter will start at 5 minutes past the scheduled game time or the agreed upon time for any team that is late or has not shown up. 6.2.6.2 \u200310 minutes past the scheduled game time, or the agreed upon time, the game will be forfeited. Please post in #match-check-in to have proof that the opposing team has not joined. 6.2.7 \u2003For Playoff matches, games beyond the first game have a break period of up to 10 minutes. If one team is not ready at that point, the team that is ready may ping the opposing captain and GM in #match-check-in. Once that ping is made, the unready team has 5 minutes to become ready. If they are still not ready, that game is forfeited by the unready team. A substitution or remake of the game will reset all of these timers. \u2003 6.3 Bugs and Exploits 6.3.1 \u2003The intentional use of any bugs, glitches, or errors in the game is forbidden. It is up to the admin\u2019s discretion to determine whether or not the use of said bugs had an effect on the match, and whether or not he will award rounds, or the match to the opposing team, or to force the match to be replayed. The usage of the following bugs is strictly forbidden, if any bug is used, which is not listed in the following rule, it is at the admin\u2019s discretion whether or not a punishment is necessary. 6.3.1.1 \u2003Examples of forbidden bugs: Moving through clipped areas where the movement is not intended by the design of the map is strictly forbidden (any walls, ceilings, floors etc). The bomb may not be planted in a location where it cannot be defused. Planting the bomb in such a way that no one can hear the beeping sound, or the planting sound is also forbidden. Boosts are generally allowed as long as they do not break other rules such as pixel walking or clipping, etc. Pixel walking is forbidden. A player will be considered to be pixel walking if they sit or stand on invisible pixels on the map, where there is no visible edge. Disrupting any map features with the use of items (e.g. stopping the train on Overpass) is not allowed. Abusing bugs in server configuration or plugins to cause unintended functionality or to bypass intended restrictions. Throwing molotovs purposely meant to clip/spread through walls or floors. 6.3.2 \u2003It is recommended to check with Admins to find out whether or not a certain bug or glitch is considered legal. Admins reserve the right to make changes, even retroactively, to this list, and rule use of bugs on a case by case basis. 6.3.2.1 \u2003Examples of allowed bugs: Skybox mollies. Throwing molotovs/incendiary grenades further than they would normally be able to be thrown before exploding by taking advantage of skybox design on a given map. Silent drops. Players can exploit or clip onto displacement brushed (textured) surfaces when dropping to reduce fall speed. Completely halting vertical movement through this method for a visible amount of time is not allowed. \u2003 6.4 Disconnect Rules 6.4.1 \u2003If a player disconnects mid-game, they are allowed to join back as soon as possible. 6.4.1.1 \u2003Technical pauses, as outlined in Rule 6.1.3.2, are allowed here to give the disconnected player reasonable time to reconnect. 6.4.2 \u2003A team whose opponent forfeits a game may choose to decline the forfeit. 6.4.3 \u2003If the game was completed the round of the disconnect the stats, as recorded at the end of the game, stand. \u2003 6.5 Game Results 6.5.1 \u2003It is the responsibility of the GMs or Captains of both teams to report the scores for their match. 6.5.2 \u2003Scores should be reported in the score reporting channels for the respective tier the match was played in. 6.5.3 \u2003For the purposes of tiebreakers, an OT result will include 15-15 plus the last overtime scoreline. (EX: A 22-18 score will count as a 19-15 score for tiebreakers) 6.5.4 \u2003Forfeits will result in a 16-0 scoreline. \u2003 6.6 Additional Game Rules 6.6.1 \u2003Using agent skins other than the default on a given map is not allowed for CSC league matches. If a player is using a different skin, the opposing team may clearly request at any time that they unequip all agent skins for the match. The team with the offending player will then take a tech pause to resolve the issue within the next two rounds. This consumes one of the offending team's tech pauses (if no pauses are left the player must still leave and unequip all agent skins). If the team and player do not make this change after being requested, they will be subject to retroactive disciplinary actions. Regardless, the game will be played out. 6.6.1.1 \u2003A player that leaves the game to equip a non-default agent skin after having default skins may be subject to punishment regardless of any attempts to correct the issue.","title":"Gameplay Rules"},{"location":"gameplay-rules/#gameplay-rules","text":"","title":"Gameplay Rules"},{"location":"gameplay-rules/#61-match-information","text":"6.1.1 \u2003For each regular season match, one game will be played.

Map 3 is decided by a knife round. 6.2.4 \u2003A knife round will occur to determine which team selects the side they want to start on in the preseason, regular season, and map 3 of the playoffs. 6.2.5 \u2003If for any reason a server restart occurs, the outcomes of previous map veto selections, knife rounds, or side selections must be duplicated as they had been determined. 6.2.6 \u2003Teams MUST join/start their match server at game time, unless otherwise agreed upon for another time by the respective GMs and they have notified the League Staff in their respective transaction channels. 6.2.6.1 \u2003A forfeit counter will start at 5 minutes past the scheduled game time or the agreed upon time for any team that is late or has not shown up. 6.2.6.2 \u200310 minutes past the scheduled game time, or the agreed upon time, the game will be forfeited. Please post in #match-check-in to have proof that the opposing team has not joined. 6.2.7 \u2003For Playoff matches, games beyond the first game have a break period of up to 10 minutes. If one team is not ready at that point, the team that is ready may ping the opposing captain and GM in #match-check-in. Once that ping is made, the unready team has 5 minutes to become ready. If they are still not ready, that game is forfeited by the unready team. A substitution or remake of the game will reset all of these timers.","title":"6.2  Game Servers"},{"location":"gameplay-rules/#63-bugs-and-exploits","text":"6.3.1 \u2003The intentional use of any bugs, glitches, or errors in the game is forbidden.

All official announcements will occur in the league\u2019s Discord server. 2.1.2 \u2003All communication is expected to occur through Discord, using either the league\u2019s server, your franchise\u2019s server, or direct messages. 2.1.3 \u2003You do not have to be in the league to be in the Discord server. 2.1.4 \u2003Any advertisement of any non-CSC related events must be cleared by Admins. \u2003 2.2 Broadcasting Rules 2.2.1 \u2003Teams are allowed to stream or record games in any way they would like. CSC only asks that any streams involving league games be \u201csafe for work\u201d. Recording of games and the saving of game replays is not required. CSC reserves the right to broadcast your games on our official Twitch/YouTube channels and to be able to spectate for the purpose of (re)broadcasting any league games. \u2003 2.3 Joining CSC 2.3.1 \u2003A signup form will be made available prior to the start of each season of CSC. 2.3.1.1 \u2003This form is for new players only. A separate Intent to Return form will be sent out to anyone already in the league as a Player, Free Agent, Permanent Free Agent, or General Manager. 2.3.2 \u2003Players must disclose all their accounts used to play Counter Strike in the signup form, whether they are regularly used or not. Failure to do so may result in consequences, including potential removal of the player from the league. 2.3.3 \u2003The player must use accounts registered with CSC for all CSC events. If you are not using the account you have indicated as your main account, you must submit this information to the staff at least 30 minutes in advance of a CSC match or event. 2.3.4 \u2003If a player is usually unavailable at the regular match time, they should not sign up for the league as a player. While it is unreasonable to expect players to never miss a scheduled time, every player should ensure they are likely to be available for most of them before signing up. Be aware that most GMs expect players to be available in advance of 10 PM ET in order to warm-up with their teams. Players should make any absence in the schedule clear to your GM. \u2003 2.4 CS:GO Bans 2.4.1 \u2003Players with banned accounts must disclose them to CSC during signups. Some banned accounts may cause the player to be ineligible to play. 2.4.2 \u2003Players actively or formerly banned by Valve, Faceit, or ESEA may be eligible to play in CSC if the account in question falls under these categories: 2.4.2.1 \u2003It is a Valve, Faceit, or ESEA account that was banned over three years ago. 2.4.2.2 \u2003It is a banned account that was successfully appealed (proof of the successful appeal is required). 2.4.2.3 \u2003The account is not banned for cheating or ban evasion (proof of this is required) 2.4.2.4 \u2003If a banned account is not reported, but would not warrant a ban from the league or a change in the players MMR, the player will be suspended for 2 regular season match days. 2.4.3 \u2003If there is a wave of inaccurate bans (evidence of this must be verifiable somewhere) admins may, at their discretion, allow players to play despite bans. 2.4.4 \u2003If the banned account does not fall under the above exceptions then that player is ineligible to play in CSC. If franchised, the offending player will also be forced onto IR (Inactive Reserve) until that ban is removed in order to allow the possibility for appeal (this does not count towards the amount of players a franchise can have on IR). Each off-season, offending players that have played on IR in this way may be either reinstated or banned from future play indefinitely based upon the status of any appeals through the party through which they are banned. Attempting to circumvent this may result in match bans. Repeat attempts may result in your removal from the league. 2.4.5 \u2003After a banned player is placed on IR or removed from the league, league members may submit evidence of prior suspicious gameplay from CSC games where the offending player might have cheated. At the discretion of the admins, the results of those games may be void, and the team of the offending player will FF retroactively. Admins will publicly display the evidence along with their reasoning of any decisions within a week after evidence is formally submitted by a GM. \u2003 2.5 Alternate Accounts 2.5.1 \u2003Players may declare alternate faceit and steam accounts in the signup form when joining the league, or by sending a message to an Admin at any time. 2.5.1.1 \u2003Alternate accounts are collected to ensure everyone is given a fair MMR value in the league. 2.5.2 \u2003If a player is found to have an alternate account they did not declare that would impact their MMR value, they are subject to punishment at Admin discretion. 2.5.2.1 \u2003These punishments include, but are not limited to, match day or season long suspensions, depending on the found discrepancy in MMR. \u2003 2.6 League Roles 2.6.1 \u2003A person who plays in the league is referred to in these rules as a player. 2.6.2 \u2003The league is led by the 5 Admins of CSC, who primarily work with long-term decisions and projects. 2.6.2.1 \u2003An admin candidate must meet certain criteria in order to be an eligible candidate. 2.5.2.1.1 \u2003You must be backed by the Backer Pool. This group will consist of any willing GM, Committee Head, or former admin (which includes admins at the end of their term) who is not running. In order to be officially backed by the pool, you must gain a vote of at least 20% of the pool (rounded up) in order to be eligible to be an active candidate for admin election discussion. You are encouraged to pursue more than this as if a backer decides to run after backing you they are eliminated from the pool. 2.5.2.1.2 \u2003You must have participated in at least one season of CSC 2.5.2.1.3 \u2003You may not currently have more than 1 serious strike or 2 normal strikes 2.5.2.1.4 \u2003You must not have been removed (or resigned to avoid removal) as admin in the past three seasons 2.6.3 \u2003The league\u2019s day-to-day activities are directed by Admins. 2.6.4 \u2003The structures of the league are operated by Staff. There are several different roles that fall under the heading of Staff. 2.6.5 \u2003The teams of the league are led by General Managers (GMs). Each GM is in charge of a grouping of teams known as a franchise. Some GMs have additional roles. GMs can be players; however, special rules apply to these circumstances. 2.6.5.1 \u2003A GM or AGM may have any Staff job other than Transaction Manager, Admin. 2.5.5.1.1 \u2003A GM or AGM in Numbers Committee may not be involved in the manual MMR adjustments of players, but may still work on the technical or formula side. 2.6.5.2 \u2003If a GM is a player, this rule supersedes the rules for players becoming Staff. The restrictions on which jobs may be taken still apply in addition to the restrictions in this rule. 2.6.6 \u2003Captains are players who have been tasked by their GM to lead a team. There are no specific responsibilities or privileges associated with being a Captain, other than what their specific GM grants them. Captains are not permitted to see privileged information. 2.6.7 \u2003Assistant GMs (AGMs) are players who are tasked with assisting their GM in various tasks. There is no requirement as to what tier they must be in. 2.6.7.1 \u2003AGMs can remain with a franchise if they are not playing the following season(s). Conditions: The AGM must have been involved in at least 1 season with CSC and the AGM cannot be on another franchise or a free agent. 2.6.7.2 \u2003AGMs may be staff, but no AGM may hold the Transaction Manager role, due to potential conflict of interests \u2003 2.7 Transactions (see Section 5 for relevant rules) 2.7.1 \u2003A player under contract with a franchise may be cut and placed on waivers. A player on waivers may have their contract claimed by another franchise. Several different circumstances may lead to a player being on waivers. 2.7.2 \u2003A trade is a type of transaction where two GMs make an exchange of players from one franchise to another. Other assets may also be traded, such as draft picks. All trades are subject to Admin review and approval. 2.7.3 \u2003A pickup is a type of transaction where a GM signs a contract with a Free Agent or a player currently on waivers. The player is then a part of that GM\u2019s franchise. 2.7.4 \u2003A cut is a type of transaction where a GM ends a contract with a player before the expiration date of that contract. The player leaves the franchise and is placed on waivers; if they are not picked up while on waivers, they will become a Free Agent. 2.7.5 \u2003Promotion and relegation refer to moving players between teams within a franchise. 2.7.6 \u2003Roster Lock is the deadline for GMs to submit initial tier rosters to League Staff. This is the day before the first regular season match day starts following the draft, at a time set by the Admins. 2.7.7 \u2003A game is a single game of Counter Strike, played between two teams. In CSC, all games are played using the default rules for a standard 5v5 CSGO match and any map permitted in competitive playlists. 2.7.8 \u2003When both teams are ready to play, the match will begin. \u2003 2.8 Clarifications 2.8.1 \u2003The rules here and elsewhere are ultimately defined and interpreted by the Admins of CSC. The Admins may fill in for any other role for decision-making as necessary. 2.8.2 \u2003The phrase \u201cAdmins and Staff\u201d or similar is frequently used. It should be noted that Admins are included in Staff (all Admins are Staff), but not the opposite (not all Staff are Admins). Admins and Staff is, therefore, slightly redundant (though it does indicate where decisions or actions are more likely to involve Admins versus just non-Admin Staff). \u2003 2.9 Terms to Know 2.9.1 \u2003A tier is a group of teams who play against each other during the season. 2.9.2 \u2003A franchise is a group of teams led by a General Manager. 2.9.3 \u2003A team is a group of five (5) players or subset of those players within a franchise. 2.9.4 \u2003A free agent is someone who can substitute on a team, or sign with a team. 2.9.5 \u2003A Permanent Free Agent can substitute for a team, but not sign to a team. 2.9.6 \u2003Inactive Reserve (IR) is for players who have to take extended breaks from the league. 2.9.7 \u2003A player in an \u201celevated role\u201d includes General Managers, AGM\u2019s, Admins, or anyone in a committee position","title":"League Info"},{"location":"league-info/#league-info","text":"","title":"League Info"},{"location":"league-info/#21-discord","text":"2.1.1 \u2003The league will make use of Discord (https://discordapp.com/) as its primary platform for communication and organization.

GMs can be players; however, special rules apply to these circumstances. 2.6.5.1 \u2003A GM or AGM may have any Staff job other than Transaction Manager, Admin. 2.5.5.1.1 \u2003A GM or AGM in Numbers Committee may not be involved in the manual MMR adjustments of players, but may still work on the technical or formula side. 2.6.5.2 \u2003If a GM is a player, this rule supersedes the rules for players becoming Staff. The restrictions on which jobs may be taken still apply in addition to the restrictions in this rule. 2.6.6 \u2003Captains are players who have been tasked by their GM to lead a team. There are no specific responsibilities or privileges associated with being a Captain, other than what their specific GM grants them. Captains are not permitted to see privileged information. 2.6.7 \u2003Assistant GMs (AGMs) are players who are tasked with assisting their GM in various tasks. There is no requirement as to what tier they must be in. 2.6.7.1 \u2003AGMs can remain with a franchise if they are not playing the following season(s). Conditions: The AGM must have been involved in at least 1 season with CSC and the AGM cannot be on another franchise or a free agent. 2.6.7.2 \u2003AGMs may be staff, but no AGM may hold the Transaction Manager role, due to potential conflict of interests","title":"2.6 League Roles"},{"location":"league-info/#27-transactions-see-section-5-for-relevant-rules","text":"2.7.1 \u2003A player under contract with a franchise may be cut and placed on waivers.

Several different circumstances may lead to a player being on waivers. 2.7.2 \u2003A trade is a type of transaction where two GMs make an exchange of players from one franchise to another. Other assets may also be traded, such as draft picks. All trades are subject to Admin review and approval. 2.7.3 \u2003A pickup is a type of transaction where a GM signs a contract with a Free Agent or a player currently on waivers. The player is then a part of that GM\u2019s franchise. 2.7.4 \u2003A cut is a type of transaction where a GM ends a contract with a player before the expiration date of that contract.

CSC is composed of a series of tiers and franchises. Each franchise has no more than one team in each tier. 4.1.2 \u2003From highest to lowest, our tiers are Premier, Elite, Challenger, Contender, and Prospect. When the rules mention promotion, this refers to players moving from lower tiers to higher ones. When the rules mention demotion, this refers to players moving from higher tiers to lower tiers. 4.1.3 \u2003Each franchise has at most one team per tier. Teams do not move between tiers, but players may move between teams in different tiers. \u2003 4.2 General Manager Rules 4.2.1 \u2003General Managers will be selected by the Admins from candidates who have requested to be considered for a position. 4.2.1.1 \u2003GMs are not required to be a player for their team, though they are permitted to be. The GM must express their desire to be a player before the draft begins. 4.2.1.1.1 \u2003A GM is allowed to switch who they have as AGM one time per AGM their franchise is allowed by the rules. For example, if a franchise is allowed one AGM by rule (Rule 4.2.2.1), they are allowed one switch of who is AGM per season. These switches are counted from the release of the tier maker to GMs until the end of the season. 4.2.1.1.2 \u2003If a GM takes over midseason, they are allowed to switch all of their allotted AGMs one time, without using their allotted switches. 4.2.1.1.3 \u2003If a GM has less than their allotted AGMs, appointing an AGM to reach the number allowed does not count as one of their switches. 4.2.1.1.4 \u2003An AGM stepping down due to leaving the league or leaving a franchise will lead to a new AGM being appointed, not an AGM switch 4.2.2 \u2003GMs are the ultimate authority for their team. This means a GM can delegate responsibilities to other members of their team. However, the GM will be the main point of contact to Admins, League Staff, and other teams\u2019 GMs for all league activities, such as managing their rosters (trades/cuts/acquisitions, deciding who will play in the next match, etc). 4.2.2.1 \u2003GMs can nominate up to 1 assistant GM (up to 2 if they have teams in at least 4 tiers), who can assume the responsibilities of that GM in their absence. 4.2.2.2 \u2003The information shared with assistant GMs (channels, discussions, etc), should be kept confidential as outlined in Section 3.3. 4.2.3 \u2003GMs are permitted to cut themselves from their team at any time post draft, if they wish. A GM who does this will not become a Free Agent, but they will be eligible to return to their own roster during the season. 4.2.3.1 \u2003A GM who wishes to return to their roster must treat this transaction the same as if they were picking up a Free Agent. Refer to Section 5.7. 4.2.4 \u2003If a GM who is not a player wishes to play in a future season, they must declare for the draft, and be drafted in the round which the Admins/League Staff specify. 4.2.4.1 \u2003If a GM promotes themselves pre-draft, they may not demote themselves after the draft in the same season. \u2003 4.3 Player Contracts 4.3.1 \u2003Potential contract MMR for each player is determined when transactions open in the offseason using a formula developed by the Admins and Staff, with the assistance of other advisors. 4.3.1.1 \u2003These are the new official MMR Contract values to be used if the player signs a new contract at any point during the season. 4.3.1.2 \u2003When transactions open in the offseason, all contract\u2019s effective MMR will be updated to their new potential contract MMR. 4.3.2 \u2003Each player drafted will be given a 2-season contract with the team that selected them at the end of roster lock. 4.3.3 \u2003When a team signs a free agent, they will go on a 2 season contract with the franchise. 4.3.4 \u2003If a season is ongoing when a contract is signed, that season counts as the first season of the contract, regardless of how much time remains in the season. 4.3.5 \u2003Any player who comes under contract with a GM must remain on an active roster until 2 match days have passed, including pre-season. Attempting to circumvent this by refusing to roster a player under this rule despite their willingness and ability to play may incur punishment from admins. 4.3.6 \u2003Players may not choose to leave a team while under contract, but may request to be cut or traded, subject to their GM\u2019s approval. 4.3.6.1 \u2003If a player is cut for refusing to play for their team, they will become a permanent free agent for 4 match days or until match day 8, whichever comes sooner. If the issue occurs after match day 8, they will become a permanent free agent for the remainder of the season. 4.3.7 \u2003Players must only play for the team they are contracted with, except where indicated otherwise in the rules. 4.3.8 \u2003Players that leave the league before their waiver period ends must re-enter the league on waivers with no tier restriction during the season or in the draft during the offseason. 4.3.9 \u2003Contracts are tracked by season, not by week. 4.3.9.1 \u2003Contracts end at 11:59 PM ET on the day after the last official CSC match of a season. 4.3.10 \u2003When a player\u2019s contract ends they can agree to renew the contract with their existing franchise in 1 season intervals. 4.3.10.1 \u2003If they do not renew with their previous franchise, they can\u2019t sign with that franchise until 2 match days have passed. 4.3.10.2 \u2003If they do not renew the contract by the contract renewal deadline they become a regular free agent (they do not go through waivers) and can be signed or get picked up in the draft. 4.3.11 \u2003A GM may choose to update a player\u2019s Current Effective Contract MMR to the minimum individual player MMR of the higher tier to allow that player to qualify for that tier. Refer to Section 5.6 for promotion rules. 4.3.12 \u2003Any free agent signing or contract renewal requires proof of agreement to be posted in the GM's transaction channel. 4.3.13 \u2003GM\u2019s and a player may agree to put a player on Inactive Reserve at any point in a season if they need to take an extended break. This allows a 6th man to join a roster temporarily. 4.3.13.1 \u2003This break must last a minimum of 4 match days. The duration of which will be determined by the length of unbroken absent match days in a given season and not when they were placed on IR. 4.3.13.2 \u2003The MMR of the 6th player replaces the MMR of the player on IR. MMR cap rules still apply. 4.3.13.3 \u2003A player on IR is not allowed to play any matches until they are taken off IR. \u2003 4.4 Franchises, Teams, And Rosters 4.4.1 \u2003Each franchise consists of a different total number of players depending on the amount of teams a GM has within the franchise. 4.4.1.1 \u2003A team may not have more than five (5) players except during the period between the draft and the Roster Lock following the draft. 4.4.1.2 \u2003A team may not have less than five (5) rostered players. 4.4.1.3 \u2003Teams may never have more than five (5) players during the season, except between the draft and the day before match day 1. 4.4.2 \u2003There are no set games played required for any rostered player. 4.4.3 \u2003Teams will still be allowed to play in a match should a team suffer a player loss outside of their control in the season, resulting in having 4 active players. 4.4.3.1 \u2003The roster should be back up to 5 players by the next match day, whether the missing player is cut or put on IR. 4.4.3.2 \u2003The only transactions allowed for such teams are signing Free Agents and promoting from a lower tier. 4.4.3.3 \u2003The MMR of the player or players lost is still active against the tier MMR cap until a replacement player or players are found. \u2003 4.5 MMR Caps 4.5.1 \u2003Each team has an MMR cap. Every team in a tier has the same cap. 4.5.2 \u2003The caps are adjusted at the beginning of every season, prior to the draft. 4.5.3 \u2003Each team must remain at or below their cap. Teams are not allowed to exceed their caps at any point, except during the period between the end of the previous season\u2019s playoffs and the Roster Lock following the current season\u2019s draft. 4.5.4 \u2003Re-signed players must stay on a roster through the draft. They cannot be cut anytime prior to the draft. They can be cut after the draft in the preseason and would then be placed on waivers. The waivers will follow the standard waiver rules.

The majority of the committee will decide if an RC member's lack of participation warrant replacement, though the intent of this is not to be used. Depending on the slot the inactive player holds, the replacement chosen will be: a. In that committee chosen and approved by RC (if a Committee Head) b. One of the [three] non-participating admins (if an Admin) c. The next most voted for player rep candidate Alternatively if a committee head is to be absent temporarily, they may proactively designate a member of their committee to represent them. Proposal 7_7 - RC Behavior Guidelines \u2003For the purposes of future elections and governing thresholds for revoking membership, RC members will be treated as staff internally. Proposal 7_10 - Player Rep Candidate Eligibility \u2003For future RC Player Rep elections, any non-admin, non-GM may run for the spot of a normal player representative if they have played in at least one season. Proposal 9_3 - GM dedicated rep \u2003Starting after S9, GMs will have a dedicated representative that GMs alone will vote for. This is an additional member of RC and does not replace another spot. The election will take place no later than when player rep elections happen. This replaces S7_9 which outlines one of the player reps becoming a GM rep if no GMs are in RC. Proposal 9_6 - Player Rep Term Length \u2003Player reps will serve for two season terms. In some cases (in order to distribute the spots up for election) certain player reps (based on placing lower in the voting than the 2 season term spots) will serve one season terms. This breakdown will be dictated before candidates are known based on RC needs. Proposal 9_7 - Player Rep Amounts \u2003There will be up to 4 player reps at a given time based on candidate amounts. In a given election/offseason, the number of candidates divided by two and rounded down will denote the maximum number of spots offered to candidates. This number will be further capped at 4 or the number of vacant player rep spots (including those at the end of their term), whichever is lower. Voting Proposal 4_1 - Voting Power \u2003[Voting] Rules Committee members will have an equal vote except in cases of recusal. Proposal 7_3 - Admin Vetoes \u2003If a proposal is set to pass and every admin unanimously agrees that the proposal is not in the best interest of CSC, they may issue a veto on that proposal. Following this, RC may convene and discuss with all admins to try and seek a resolution. If all admins continue to be in opposition, every other member of RC (in this case 8 members) have the ability to override the veto and pass the proposal if they so choose. Proposal 7_11 - Emergency Rule Creation \u2003If during the middle of the season a majority of admins ask for specific rule changes, a unanimous vote by all RC members can allow for a modification to the rules without timing restrictions. This is intended to be used only under an extreme circumstance. Proposal 9_1 - Passing Threshold \u2003At least sixty percent of active RC must vote in favor of a proposal for it to pass in addition to any other requirements. Proposal 9_2 - Quorum \u2003As an additional requirement for a proposal to pass, a proposal must have been voted on by at least 75% of active RC. Workflow Proposal 7_4 - Rules Committee Leader \u2003Informally, RC will designate one willing person in RC to provide some structure to RC meetings and organization. This role does not hold any formal power beyond a normal vote but offers some organization and direction to help RC stay focused on its goals. They may designate members of RC to perform some housekeeping tasks to facilitate RC's functions. Proposal 9_4 - RC Voting Logs \u2003Each rule change will also have the exact members and their votes recorded and posted publicly. Proposal 9_5 - Rule In Effect Delay \u2003By default, rules are subject to become in effect no sooner than 7 days after being formally passed. This is to give time for the community to react to new rules and for RC to be able to react and potentially pause a rule from going into effect if needed. Certain categories such as some transaction, playoff, and other rules will default to the following season if passed mid-season. RC may explicitly ignore this policy on a rule by rule basis. Proposal 9_8 - RC Information Convenience \u2003Each off-season, RC will post the prospective \"to-do\" list of rule changes in the discord. Additionally, each time that a new rule enters discussion in an RC thread, a discord post will also go out detailing the key information that began the discussion.","title":"Rules Committee Policies"},{"location":"rc-policies/#rules-committee-policies","text":"The following policies are self-administered guidelines that help facilitate the operation of Rules Committee.

The draft is a way to assign new players to franchises. This is akin to the entry draft in many professional sports. 7.1.2 \u2003The draft is held on a Staff-selected date and time. 7.1.3 \u2003League Staff reserve the right to suspend the draft due to time constraints, and resume it at a future date and time that will be announced the day after the delay. 7.1.4 \u2003All players who sign up will be researched by the League Staff prior to the draft for data about their MMR. This data will be shared openly with all GMs prior to the draft, and GMs are encouraged to do any additional research on their own which they believe will help them have a good draft class. 7.1.5 \u2003All players who wish to play in CSC must enter via the draft process. All new players will be drafted. 7.1.6 \u2003Free Agents that are not signed by a team by the draft deadline date are placed in the draft. 7.1.7 \u2003The draft consists of all new players who have registered for the season but have not participated in a prior season of CSC, any Free Agents who are placed in the draft, currently rostered players (as keeper picks), and any GMs who intend to play this season but were not on a team at the end of the preceding season. 7.1.8 \u2003The draft is divided into one section for each tier. Players are placed into the draft based on what tier they are eligible for. 7.1.8.1 \u2003General Managers only have draft picks for the tiers in which they have teams. 7.1.8.2 \u2003GMs who have players in the draft must spend draft picks on those players. These fall into rounds specified by league staff. These are called keeper picks. 7.1.8.3 \u2003GM must note if they are declaring a player into a higher MMR tier than that player is eligible for by the resigning deadline. 7.1.8.4 \u2003MMR will be calculated and shown what MMR ranges warrant which keeper rounds. 7.1.8.5 \u2003If a GM has more than 1 player in the same round (determined by MMR), they will be forced to use a pick higher than the current if the GM doesn\u2019t have enough picks in that round. They can also choose to cut one player. They can not use a lower pick to keep a player. 7.1.9 \u2003If a GM does not have enough picks available in that tier\u2019s draft, they must give up current players to waivers/free agency to accommodate. 7.1.10 \u2003There may be Admin overrulings to trades made during the season for trades out of the ordinary, at the Admins\u2019 discretion. 7.1.11 \u2003Concerning GMs who will also play on their team: the League Staff will mandate to you what round of the draft that you must select yourself. This is non-negotiable. All players who signed up will be split into tiers based on their MMR. 7.1.11.1 \u2003For example, if a Faceit level 10 wants to GM and play, they will likely be in the 1st round and therefore must select themselves with their first pick, whereas a GM/player of lower rank must select themselves in the round which corresponds to their tier, allowing them to have the chance to draft higher ranked players before drafting themselves, in an effort to ensure parity for the teams. 7.1.12 \u2003GMs will draft players until all available rookies have been drafted. As this will put them over the total allotted roster spots, they will need to determine who to release from their team into Free Agency no later than the day before the first match day. 7.1.13 \u2003If a GM cannot be present for the entire draft, they may indicate a player on their team who will continue making picks on behalf of the GM. These picks are made as if the GM had made them, and are considered official. All rules regarding GM knowledge, including not revealing Contract MMR, must continue to be followed. Any part of the draft rules which apply to GMs otherwise apply to the selected player during the draft. 7.1.14 \u2003If a GM or their representative does not select a pick in a reasonable timeframe as determined by League Staff or is unable to continue the draft, their pick will be selected by League Staff each round based on the highest available MMR player. 7.1.15 \u2003The draft is held live on Twitch. All GMs are required to be present in the GM Room Discord channel (or another channel as indicated by League Staff) for the duration of the draft. See Section 1.1.13 for when a GM cannot be present. 7.2 Draft Lottery 7.2.1 \u2003The draft order is decided by a lottery before offseason transactions open. 7.2.2 \u2003Each tier has its own draft order. 7.2.3 \u2003The draft is a snake order draft, so the GM with the first pick in Round 1 will have the last pick in Round 2, before any trades occur. 7.3 Draft Lottery Odds 7.3.1 \u2003The regular season win-rate will be calculated from 0 to 1 and will be multiplied by .75 (this term is called wr). Each team will get a point for each stage of playoffs reached (0 for not reaching playoffs, 1 for losing in first stage of playoffs, 2 for losing in the second stage, etc. n-1 for losing in the finals, n for winning the finals). If all teams in a tier reach playoffs then each of the previous values will be decreased by one as to not penalize tiers where all teams reach playoffs. This value will be divided by n and multiplied by .25 (this term is called pp). Each team\u2019s draft odds will then be [2 - wr - pp]. n is the number of rounds in the playoffs. 7.3.2 \u2003In special cases, such as a lot of teams being added or very few players returning, draft odds can be set to equal for all teams, at the discretion of Admins. 7.3.3 \u2003In the case of a new team being added to a tier where they do not have a previous season record to apply the 7.3.1 formula, their odds will automatically become the max odds value (2). \u2003 Preseason 8.1.1 \u2003Preseason lasts from the season\u2019s draft until the official Roster Lock date. In this time, there will be 2 cut days. 8.1.1.1 \u2003The first cut time is the night of the second pre-season match at 11:59pm EST. Teams must be at a maximum of 6 rostered players. 8.1.1.2 \u2003The second cut day is the night of the third pre-season match at 11:59pm EST. Teams must be at a maximum of 5 rostered players. 8.1.2 \u2003A player who was drafted must play in a preseason match (a scrim doesn't count) before being cut in the preseason. A player who is unresponsive, unwilling, or unavailable at game time is excluded from this requirement. Evidence of this should be shown in a GM\u2019s transaction channel. \u2003 Regular Season 9.1.1 \u2003During the season, franchises are sorted into conferences randomly to determine who they play, when they play them, and where they will be placed in the playoffs bracket upon qualification. 9.1.1.1 \u2003If a franchise only has teams in, for example, one tier, they will be separated before the others are randomized to ensure one conference will not have more teams in a different tier. 9.1.2 \u2003Matches will take place on the scheduled date, unless rescheduled. Matches can be played before the scheduled date and time, or any time up to 11:59pm of the next match day except for during that match day's normal match time. However the last regular season match for each tier cannot be rescheduled past the day after the original date. If a match is rescheduled both GMs must post the change in their respective transaction channels, exceptions to this can be made under admin discretion. Reschedules must be clearly communicated to admins, the heads of tech committee, and transactions. 9.1.2.1 \u2003Both GMs or their representatives must agree to any rescheduled matches, and they must both notify League Staff of the new match time by posting in their respective transaction channels. 9.1.2.2 \u2003If, after both teams have agreed to a match time, one team needs to reschedule, both parties must agree to reschedule. Otherwise, the match time will not be moved. If the team cannot play after scheduling a time, they must forfeit the match for that day. 9.1.2.3 \u2003A match must be rescheduled and announced by GMs in their respective transaction channels at least 10 minutes prior to the start of the currently scheduled match time. There is no limit to the number of times a match can be rescheduled. 9.1.2.4 \u2003If the match is rescheduled, the new match time will be treated as equivalent to the original match time for the purposes of all rules contained in this document. 9.1.2.5 \u2003Should special circumstances occur, a contingency day can be used to reschedule matches if sanctioned by League Staff. 9.1.3 \u2003CSC will attempt to stream showcase matches every match day. These are not mandatory, but are recommended! 9.1.4 \u2003If two or more teams have the same regular season win percentage, ties between the teams will be resolved using the following tiebreakers (with a precision to the rounded hundredths): 9.1.4.1 \u2003Conference Record 9.1.4.2 \u2003Head to Head Record (among games between the tied teams) 9.1.4.3 \u2003Head to Head Round Differential (among games between the tied teams) 9.1.4.4 \u2003Overall Round Win Percentage 9.1.4.5 \u2003Strength of schedule - avg winrate of each opponent weighted by the number of times you faced that opponent 9.1.4.6 \u2003(Optional) GM 1v1 9.1.4.7 \u2003Coin Flip 9.1.5 \u2003In the event of a tie between 3 or more teams, if any team(s) are able to be separated, each group of remaining tied teams will independently restart the tiebreaking process at 9.1.4.1. 9.1.5.1 \u2003For example Teams A, B, C, and D are tied and are not in conferences. If Team A and Team B are 2-1 against these teams (H2H), and Teams C and D are 1-2 against these teams. Then A and B will be isolated from C and D and will be placed above them. A and B then will go back to conference (in this case H2H record) and tiebreak again. C and D will do the same. If A beat B and C beat D then the final order will be A, B, C, D. \u2003 Playoffs and Beyond 10.1 General Playoff Info 10.1.1 \u2003Playoffs will begin on the first match day at the conclusion of the regular season in a tier. 10.1.2 \u2003Each tier will play in their own separate playoffs. 10.1.3 \u2003During the postseason, the higher seed is the home team, and will decide whether they want to veto first or second. 10.1.3.1 \u2003Veto rules are outlined above in Rule 6.2.3. 10.1.4 \u2003The playoffs will be played in a Best of 3 format. 10.1.5 \u2003The Finals will be set up similar to the rest of the playoffs with a Best of 3 structure. \u2003 10.2 Other Playoff Rules 10.2.1 \u2003Playoff substitutions may happen before or between games. A request for a sub must be completed prior to the pistol round. If damage in the knife round was dealt before the request was made, then the result of the knife round must be replicated. If a Transaction Manager is not available, the sub may be used on an honor system. If the sub was invalid, then that match is forfeited. 10.2.2 \u2003During a match, a round can be restarted if a technical issue occurs, if no damage has been dealt. A player must put \"not live\" in chat so the other team knows not to continue playing. The reason for a round restart must be strictly lag or server disconnect related. \u2003 10.3 Offseason 10.3.1 \u2003After the playoffs, there will be an offseason. 10.3.1.1 \u2003During this offseason, any new players which have signed up for the league will be evaluated by League Staff and entered into the draft for the next season. See the draft rules in Section 1.1. 10.3.1.2 \u2003Transactions are closed until a future date, decided by the admins, between the start of combines and the next preseason. However for the duration of combines there will be an \"Early\" Transaction Window, GMs may cut and re-sign their players from the previous season outside of the normal transactions window.","title":"Season Overview"},{"location":"season-overview/#season-overview","text":"","title":"Season overview"},{"location":"season-overview/#before-preseason","text":"","title":"Before Preseason"},{"location":"season-overview/#71-the-draft","text":"7.1.1 \u2003The first official event in each season of CSC is the draft.

We will use this waiver order for cuts made after the resigning period, prior to players being declared for the draft. 5.2.6 \u2003All GMs who wish to acquire a player on waivers must notify Transaction Managers during the waiver period, using their transaction channel. 5.2.7 \u2003Under no circumstance will GMs be put on waivers. \u2003 5.3 Trades 5.3.1 \u2003Trades are expected to be executed in good faith. Abusing the trading system is subject to admin and/or transaction-placed restrictions on trading/transactions. 5.3.2 \u2003If mutually agreed upon by the GMs of all teams involved, players may be traded between teams pending league approval, so long as it does not cause either party to exceed the MMR cap. 5.3.3 \u2003This is a trade of the player and their contract. The player MMR and the length of their contract will not change during a trade. 5.3.4 \u2003Draft picks and players are only allowed to be traded within the same tier. This means a GM can not trade an Elite Player or draft picks for Prospect players or draft picks, vice versa. A GM may make three transactions that bypass this restriction per season. (Starting season 10) 5.3.4.1 \u2003Only picks for the next draft can be traded except during the offseason, when picks for the current and following season\u2019s draft can be traded. 5.3.4.1.1 \u2003Examples: During the season 6 regular season, only draft picks for the season 7 draft can be traded. During the offseason prior to the season 7 draft, only draft picks for the season 7 and 8 drafts can be traded. 5.3.4.2 \u2003If there is a reasonable doubt, accompanied with evidence, that the GM of a franchise or the franchise itself will not return in the following season, then admins may hold a vote to remove the ability for that franchise to make trades for the duration of the season, and also reverse any trades by that franchise during the week prior to the start of the vote. 5.3.4.2.1 \u2003The vote will last until all Admins have made a decision. 5.3.4.2.2 \u2003The franchise in question will not be able to make trades while the vote is ongoing. 5.3.4.2.3 \u2003The vote will be majority wins, with every admin voting for, against, or abstaining. In the event of a tie, the vote will fail and the franchise will be able to trade. 5.3.4.2.4 \u2003If the vote fails, another vote that targets the same franchise cannot be called until at least 4 match days have passed. 5.3.4.3 \u2003The following rules only apply to trading draft picks in the offseason prior, as to help protect potential new GMs and minimize the possible abuse of future draft pick trading. 5.3.4.3.1 \u2003Examples: These rules apply to trading a season 4 draft pick during the season 3 regular season. These rules do not apply to trading a season 4 draft pick during the offseason prior to season 4. 5.3.4.3.2 \u2003Only 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th round draft picks can be traded. 5.3.4.3.3 \u2003All franchises must maintain at least one pick in the first two rounds of each tier. 5.3.4.3.4 \u2003All franchises must maintain at least three picks in the first five rounds of each tier. \u2003 5.4 Substitutions 5.4.1 \u2003Any player may fill in as a sub in a higher tier if they wish. 5.4.1.1 \u2003A team in a higher tier may not get a substitute from a lower tier until after 8pm EST on a match day. Example: An Elite team can not get a Challenger player as a substitute until after 8pm. 5.4.2 \u2003A player may sub up to another team within the same franchise on the same match night, even if they play with a different team in their franchise at a different point in that match night. 5.4.3 \u2003Players may not sub down to a team in a lower tier for any reason. 5.4.4 \u2003A commitment to subbing or signing for a team, once submitted by a GM or AGM, restricts you to only playing for that team for that match day. 5.4.4.1 \u2003A GM or AGM that asks for a commitment from a player to sub or sign for/by a given match day must field that player if the player is able 5.4.5 \u2003Teams must field at least 4 players to start a league match. You may only play with fewer players if the match is already in progress. 5.4.6 \u2003Players may substitute up from a lower tier during the playoffs, following the same rules as the regular season, with the following changes: 5.4.6.1 \u2003Playoff substitutions may happen before or between games. A request for a sub must be completed prior to the pistol round. If damage in the knife round was dealt before the request was made, then the result of the knife round must be replicated. If a Transaction Manager is not available, the sub may be used on an honor system. If the sub was invalid, then that match is forfeited. 5.4.6.2 \u2003Each player may substitute up once during the entire playoffs, for an entire match night or fraction thereof. 5.4.6.3 \u2003They may play with their own team during any playoff night, even if they play with a different team in their franchise at a different point in that match night. 5.4.6.4 \u2003No games will be delayed to benefit players who are substituting with another team, with admin discretion. 5.4.6.5 \u2003A player may not switch teams during concurrently-running matches. \u2003 5.5 Cuts 5.5.1 \u2003All players are subject to be cut from their team at any time, and for any reason, by their GM. 5.5.2 \u2003Contracted players who are cut will go through a waiver period where they can be picked up by another team should that team\u2019s GM decide to acquire them, and their existing contract. 5.5.3 \u2003Players who went through the draft in the current season do not go through waivers if they are cut prior to the Roster Lock. 5.5.4 \u2003Cut players who are not picked up on waivers will become uncontracted Free Agents. 5.5.5 \u2003A cut player cannot be picked up by the same team until two match days have passed. \u2003 5.6 Promotion/Relegation 5.6.1 \u2003If a player is promoted pre-draft, they must remain on the team they were promoted to unless they are cut. 5.6.1.1 \u2003If they are cut, they will go on waivers for their original tier and they are eligible to play for their original tier again for any franchise. They are then eligible to play for the tier they were promoted from for the franchise they started on, but that franchise must still wait two match days before they can sign them again. 5.6.2 \u2003If a player is promoted post-draft, they will remain on the team they were promoted to unless they are cut or demoted. 5.6.3 \u2003A player can only be demoted one tier at a time. This means that a player cannot be relegated from the Elite tier to the Prospect tier, for example. Refer to Section 4.1.2 for tier hierarchy. 5.6.4 \u2003A player demoted to a lower tier cannot be promoted back to the higher tier until the end of their waiver period. 5.6.5 \u2003A GM can decide to promote or demote a player within their franchise. 5.6.5.1 \u2003The player and GM must both agree in writing before either of the following can take effect. 5.6.5.1.1 \u2003If a GM decides to promote a player within their franchise, there must be an open position available on the team that player is being promoted to, or the GM must declare which player is being demoted or cut while making the promotion. 5.6.5.1.2 \u2003If a GM decides to relegate a player within their franchise, there must be an open position on the team the player is being relegated to, or the GM must declare which player is being promoted or cut while making the relegation, subject to the outcome of the waiver period. 5.6.6 \u2003Demoted players will go on waivers in the tier they are demoted to. 5.6.7 \u2003In the event that a relegated player is picked up by a different team, that player\u2019s original GM is still permitted to promote the initially declared player, or to select a Free Agent to fill the spot. 5.6.8 \u2003Players promoted or relegated can play on the same match day, so long as it does not cause any team to exceed the MMR cap. 5.6.9 \u2003If a promoted player is traded, they retain their contract and must stay in the tier they were promoted to. 5.6.9.1 \u2003The new GM can demote the player at any time, if they wish. 5.6.10 \u2003If a player is promoted pre-draft, and then cut in the preseason, they may not be picked up by that same franchise in the same season, they must sign with a different franchise first. \u2003 5.7 Free Agents 5.7.1 \u2003Free Agents have the option of which franchise to join if multiple Franchises make offers. They can also choose to decline all offers and remain a Free Agent. Free Agents cannot exercise this choice for Waiver claims. See Section 5.2 for Waiver rules. 5.7.2 \u2003GMs and Free Agents may sign Free Agent Temporary Contracts for one match day. This is a substitution, as outlined in Section 5.4. The Free Agent\u2019s contract MMR replaces the absent player\u2019s contract MMR. 5.7.2.1 \u2003The Free Agent has the option to choose which team to substitute for if multiple teams make offers, and they can choose to decline a temporary contract with no consequences. 5.7.2.2 \u2003When using Temporary Substitutions, GM's may use any substitute player which keeps them under their teams cap. Under no circumstance may a GM exceed their team's cap. 5.7.2.3 \u2003The replaced player cannot play on that team that match day. 5.7.2.4 \u2003This temp contract requires the GM to play the Free Agent that match day. 5.7.2.5 \u2003Free Agents must be signed 30 minutes before match start time. 5.7.3 \u2003New players may be brought into CSC mid-season as FAs should a special circumstance arise and be approved by the Admins. 5.7.3.1 \u2003If there are ever less than 1/3 active free agents per team in any tier and at least 3 permanent free agents who are interested in becoming regular free agents, permanent free agents will be promoted to regular free agency until there are at least 3/4 active free agents per team in that tier. 5.7.3.1.1 \u2003Only permanent free agents who were permanent free agents when the tier was confirmed to have less than 1/3 free agents per team will be eligible to be promoted to regular free agency. 5.7.3.1.2 \u2003Any permanent free agents moved to normal free agency via this method will immediately go on waivers following the rules in Section 5.2. 5.7.3.1.3 \u2003This process can only be done in the first 3/4 of the season, after which no more permanent free agents may be added to the regular free agency pool 5.7.4 \u2003After the 3rd and 6th match days respectively, every free agent will be DM'ed, and any who do not respond by the next Tuesday will be marked as inactive and will not be able to play in the league until they respond to the official DM (when they do respond, they will be placed on waivers). \u2003 5.8 Permanent Free Agents 5.8.1 \u2003Players will be allowed to sign up for the league as a permanent free agent after the draft. By doing this, they waive their ability to join a team on anything other than a temporary, one match day contract. All normal temporary substitution rules will apply to them. They will still have an MMR value and a minimum tier appointed to them by the league. 5.8.1.1 \u2003Permanent Free Agents adhere to all the same rules as normal Free Agents. 5.8.2 \u2003No Permanent Free Agent can be the sub for one team two match nights in a row. For example, a Permanent Free Agent could play for the same team match days 3 and 5, but not 3 and 4. 5.8.3 \u2003Permanent free agents from a previous season will have to return to the league through the draft if they want to return as a regular player. The only exception to this is if the player had been a regular player in a previous season and completed their most recent contract or finished the previous season as a regular free agent; in which case they will return as a regular free agent. 5.8.3.1 \u2003Former players who sign up in the offseason will be placed into the draft if they were still under contract when they left the league in a previous season. 5.8.4 \u2003If at some point during the season the Admins feel that there is a lack of regular free agents for a specific tier, they can promote permanent free agents to regular free agent status to return free agent numbers to an ideal amount. 5.8.4.1 \u2003The permanent free agent(s) to be promoted will be determined based on the date and time in which the permanent free agent(s) signed up for the league, with those that signed up earliest being selected first.","title":"Transactions"},{"location":"transactions/#transactions","text":"","title":"Transactions"},{"location":"transactions/#51-general-transactions","text":"5.1.1 \u2003Transaction deadline is 9:59 PM ET, 2 match days before the start of playoffs.
