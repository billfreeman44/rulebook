<h2 id="51-general-transactions">5.1  General Transactions</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>5.1.1</strong>&emsp;Transaction deadline is 9:59 PM ET, 2 match days before the start of playoffs. After this, teams can only use one sub per match day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.1.2</strong>&emsp;Any transaction requests posted 30 minutes before a match start time will be handled by a Transaction Manager, provided that they are posted in the appropriate transaction channel, with all needed evidence, and satisfy all roster and other transaction rules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.1.3</strong>&emsp;Transaction requests posted after 30 minutes before match start time will be handled as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>5.1.3.1</strong>&emsp;Temporary Free Agent contract requests will be considered invalid;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.1.3.2</strong>&emsp;Other transactions (e.g. trades, cuts, Free Agent pickups) will be processed after that day's matches complete and before the next match day's games start.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&emsp;</p>
<h2 id="52-waivers">5.2  Waivers</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>5.2.1</strong>&emsp;A player claimed on waivers can only be claimed onto the corresponding tier the player was demoted or cut from.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>5.2.1.1</strong>&emsp;If a player is on waivers before roster lock because of an absence from the league, they may be FA claimed onto any tier they are eligible for.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.2.2</strong>&emsp;Waiver order will be determined by the team’s record, inverse to the tier in which the transaction takes place. Waivers will be updated after every 2nd match day.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>5.2.2.1</strong>&emsp;When a team makes a waiver claim, they will move to last in the waiver order for their tier until the next waiver update.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.2.3</strong>&emsp;Waivers will end every Monday 11:59pm EST and Wednesday 11:59pm EST. A player that is cut or made active from their inactive tag will be available on the closest date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.2.4</strong>&emsp;Waivers at the start of the season will be based on the inverse of the draft, per tier. If a team had the last pick in the draft, they will receive the first spot on waivers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.2.5</strong>&emsp;The waiver order will continue into Offseason. We will use this waiver order for cuts made after the resigning period, prior to players being declared for the draft.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.2.6</strong>&emsp;All GMs who wish to acquire a player on waivers must notify Transaction Managers during the waiver period, using their transaction channel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.2.7</strong>&emsp;Under no circumstance will GMs be put on waivers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&emsp;</p>
<h2 id="53-trades">5.3  Trades</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>5.3.1</strong>&emsp;Trades are expected to be executed in good faith. Abusing the trading system is subject to admin and/or transaction-placed restrictions on trading/transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.3.2</strong>&emsp;If mutually agreed upon by the GMs of all teams involved, players may be traded between teams pending league approval, so long as it does not cause either party to exceed the MMR cap.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.3.3</strong>&emsp;This is a trade of the player and their contract. The player MMR and the length of their contract will not change during a trade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.3.4</strong>&emsp;Draft picks and players are only allowed to be traded within the same tier. This means a GM can not trade an Elite Player or draft picks for Prospect players or draft picks, vice versa. A GM may make three transactions that bypass this restriction per season. (Starting season 10)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>5.3.4.1</strong>&emsp;Only picks for the next draft can be traded except during the offseason, when picks for the current and following season’s draft can be traded.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>5.3.4.1.1</strong>&emsp;Examples: During the season 6 regular season, only draft picks for the season 7 draft can be traded. During the offseason prior to the season 7 draft, only draft picks for the season 7 and 8 drafts can be traded.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.3.4.2</strong>&emsp;If there is a reasonable doubt, accompanied with evidence, that the GM of a franchise or the franchise itself will not return in the following season, then admins may hold a vote to remove the ability for that franchise to make trades for the duration of the season, and also reverse any trades by that franchise during the week prior to the start of the vote.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>5.3.4.2.1</strong>&emsp;The vote will last until all Admins have made a decision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.3.4.2.2</strong>&emsp;The franchise in question will not be able to make trades while the vote is ongoing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.3.4.2.3</strong>&emsp;The vote will be majority wins, with every admin voting for, against, or abstaining. In the event of a tie, the vote will fail and the franchise will be able to trade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.3.4.2.4</strong>&emsp;If the vote fails, another vote that targets the same franchise cannot be called until at least 4 match days have passed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.3.4.3</strong>&emsp;The following rules only apply to trading draft picks in the offseason prior, as to help protect potential new GMs and minimize the possible abuse of future draft pick trading.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>5.3.4.3.1</strong>&emsp;Examples: These rules apply to trading a season 4 draft pick during the season 3 regular season. These rules do not apply to trading a season 4 draft pick during the offseason prior to season 4.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.3.4.3.2</strong>&emsp;Only 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th round draft picks can be traded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.3.4.3.3</strong>&emsp;All franchises must maintain at least one pick in the first two rounds of each tier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.3.4.3.4</strong>&emsp;All franchises must maintain at least three picks in the first five rounds of each tier.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&emsp;</p>
<h2 id="54-substitutions">5.4  Substitutions</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>5.4.1</strong>&emsp;Any player may fill in as a sub in a higher tier if they wish.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>5.4.1.1</strong>&emsp;A team in a higher tier may not get a substitute from a lower tier until after 8pm EST on a match day. Example: An Elite team can not get a Challenger player as a substitute until after 8pm.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.4.2</strong>&emsp;A player may sub up to another team within the same franchise on the same match night, even if they play with a different team in their franchise at a different point in that match night.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.4.3</strong>&emsp;Players may not sub down to a team in a lower tier for any reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.4.4</strong>&emsp;A commitment to subbing or signing for a team, once submitted by a GM or AGM, restricts you to only playing for that team for that match day.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>5.4.4.1</strong>&emsp;A GM or AGM that asks for a commitment from a player to sub or sign for/by a given match day must field that player if the player is able</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.4.5</strong>&emsp;Teams must field at least 4 players to start a league match. You may only play with fewer players if the match is already in progress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.4.6</strong>&emsp;Players may substitute up from a lower tier during the playoffs, following the same rules as the regular season, with the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>5.4.6.1</strong>&emsp;Playoff substitutions may happen before or between games. A request for a sub must be completed prior to the pistol round. If damage in the knife round was dealt before the request was made, then the result of the knife round must be replicated. If a Transaction Manager is not available, the sub may be used on an honor system. If the sub was invalid, then that match is forfeited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.4.6.2</strong>&emsp;Each player may substitute up once during the entire playoffs, for an entire match night or fraction thereof.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.4.6.3</strong>&emsp;They may play with their own team during any playoff night, even if they play with a different team in their franchise at a different point in that match night.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.4.6.4</strong>&emsp;No games will be delayed to benefit players who are substituting with another team, with admin discretion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.4.6.5</strong>&emsp;A player may not switch teams during concurrently-running matches.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&emsp;</p>
<h2 id="55-cuts">5.5  Cuts</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>5.5.1</strong>&emsp;All players are subject to be cut from their team at any time, and for any reason, by their GM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.5.2</strong>&emsp;Contracted players who are cut will go through a waiver period where they can be picked up by another team should that team’s GM decide to acquire them, and their existing contract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.5.3</strong>&emsp;Players who went through the draft in the current season do not go through waivers if they are cut prior to the Roster Lock.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.5.4</strong>&emsp;Cut players who are not picked up on waivers will become uncontracted Free Agents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.5.5</strong>&emsp;A cut player cannot be picked up by the same team until two match days have passed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&emsp;</p>
<h2 id="56-promotionrelegation">5.6  Promotion/Relegation</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>5.6.1</strong>&emsp;If a player is promoted pre-draft, they must remain on the team they were promoted to unless they are cut.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>5.6.1.1</strong>&emsp;If they are cut, they will go on waivers for their original tier and they are eligible to play for their original tier again for any franchise. They are then eligible to play for the tier they were promoted from for the franchise they started on, but that franchise must still wait two match days before they can sign them again.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.6.2</strong>&emsp;If a player is promoted post-draft, they will remain on the team they were promoted to unless they are cut or demoted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.6.3</strong>&emsp;A player can only be demoted one tier at a time. This means that a player cannot be relegated from the Elite tier to the Prospect tier, for example. Refer to Section 4.1.2 for tier hierarchy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.6.4</strong>&emsp;A player demoted to a lower tier cannot be promoted back to the higher tier until the end of their waiver period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.6.5</strong>&emsp;A GM can decide to promote or demote a player within their franchise.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>5.6.5.1</strong>&emsp;The player and GM must both agree in writing before either of the following can take effect.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>5.6.5.1.1</strong>&emsp;If a GM decides to promote a player within their franchise, there must be an open position available on the team that player is being promoted to, or the GM must declare which player is being demoted or cut while making the promotion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.6.5.1.2</strong>&emsp;If a GM decides to relegate a player within their franchise, there must be an open position on the team the player is being relegated to, or the GM must declare which player is being promoted or cut while making the relegation, subject to the outcome of the waiver period.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.6.6</strong>&emsp;Demoted players will go on waivers in the tier they are demoted to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.6.7</strong>&emsp;In the event that a relegated player is picked up by a different team, that player’s original GM is still permitted to promote the initially declared player, or to select a Free Agent to fill the spot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.6.8</strong>&emsp;Players promoted or relegated can play on the same match day, so long as it does not cause any team to exceed the MMR cap.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.6.9</strong>&emsp;If a promoted player is traded, they retain their contract and must stay in the tier they were promoted to.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>5.6.9.1</strong>&emsp;The new GM can demote the player at any time, if they wish.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.6.10</strong>&emsp;If a player is promoted pre-draft, and then cut in the preseason, they may not be picked up by that same franchise in the same season, they must sign with a different franchise first.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&emsp;</p>
<h2 id="57-free-agents">5.7  Free Agents</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>5.7.1</strong>&emsp;Free Agents have the option of which franchise to join if multiple Franchises make offers. They can also choose to decline all offers and remain a Free Agent. Free Agents cannot exercise this choice for Waiver claims. See Section 5.2 for Waiver rules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.7.2</strong>&emsp;GMs and Free Agents may sign Free Agent Temporary Contracts for one match day. This is a substitution, as outlined in Section 5.4. The Free Agent’s contract MMR replaces the absent player’s contract MMR.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>5.7.2.1</strong>&emsp;The Free Agent has the option to choose which team to substitute for if multiple teams make offers, and they can choose to decline a temporary contract with no consequences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.7.2.2</strong>&emsp;When using Temporary Substitutions, GM's may use any substitute player which keeps them under their teams cap. Under no circumstance may a GM exceed their team's cap.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.7.2.3</strong>&emsp;The replaced player cannot play on that team that match day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.7.2.4</strong>&emsp;This temp contract requires the GM to play the Free Agent that match day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.7.2.5</strong>&emsp;Free Agents must be signed 30 minutes before match start time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.7.3</strong>&emsp;New players may be brought into CSC mid-season as FAs should a special circumstance arise and be approved by the Admins.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>5.7.3.1</strong>&emsp;If there are ever less than 1/3 active free agents per team in any tier and at least 3 permanent free agents who are interested in becoming regular free agents, permanent free agents will be promoted to regular free agency until there are at least 3/4 active free agents per team in that tier.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>5.7.3.1.1</strong>&emsp;Only permanent free agents who were permanent free agents when the tier was confirmed to have less than 1/3 free agents per team will be eligible to be promoted to regular free agency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.7.3.1.2</strong>&emsp;Any permanent free agents moved to normal free agency via this method will immediately go on waivers following the rules in Section 5.2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.7.3.1.3</strong>&emsp;This process can only be done in the first 3/4 of the season, after which no more permanent free agents may be added to the regular free agency pool</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.7.4</strong>&emsp;After the 3rd and 6th match days respectively, every free agent will be DM'ed, and any who do not respond by the next Tuesday will be marked as inactive and will not be able to play in the league until they respond to the official DM (when they do respond, they will be placed on waivers).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&emsp;</p>
<h2 id="58-permanent-free-agents">5.8  Permanent Free Agents</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>5.8.1</strong>&emsp;Players will be allowed to sign up for the league as a permanent free agent after the draft. By doing this, they waive their ability to join a team on anything other than a temporary, one match day contract. All normal temporary substitution rules will apply to them. They will still have an MMR value and a minimum tier appointed to them by the league.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>5.8.1.1</strong>&emsp;Permanent Free Agents adhere to all the same rules as normal Free Agents.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.8.2</strong>&emsp;No Permanent Free Agent can be the sub for one team two match nights in a row. For example, a Permanent Free Agent could play for the same team match days 3 and 5, but not 3 and 4.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.8.3</strong>&emsp;Permanent free agents from a previous season will have to return to the league through the draft if they want to return as a regular player. The only exception to this is if the player had been a regular player in a previous season and completed their most recent contract or finished the previous season as a regular free agent; in which case they will return as a regular free agent.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>5.8.3.1</strong>&emsp;Former players who sign up in the offseason will be placed into the draft if they were still under contract when they left the league in a previous season.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.8.4</strong>&emsp;If at some point during the season the Admins feel that there is a lack of regular free agents for a specific tier, they can promote permanent free agents to regular free agent status to return free agent numbers to an ideal amount.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>5.8.4.1</strong>&emsp;The permanent free agent(s) to be promoted will be determined based on the date and time in which the permanent free agent(s) signed up for the league, with those that signed up earliest being selected first.</li>
</ul>
</li>
