                <h1 id="rules-committee-policies">Rules Committee Policies</h1>
<p>The following policies are self-administered guidelines that help facilitate the operation of Rules Committee. Primarily the body meets during the off-season after elections are finished. Currently the body includes admins, committee heads, player reps, and GM reps.
&emsp;</p>
<h4 id="membership">Membership</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Proposal 7_1  -  Replacement</strong>&emsp;The admins will choose amongst themselves who will be a part of RC. The majority of the committee will decide if an RC member's lack of participation warrant replacement, though the intent of this is not to be used. Depending on the slot the inactive player holds, the replacement chosen will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>a. In that committee chosen and approved by RC (if a Committee Head)</li>
<li>b. One of the [three] non-participating admins (if an Admin)</li>
<li>c. The next most voted for player rep candidate</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively if a committee head is to be absent temporarily, they may proactively designate a member of their committee to represent them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proposal 7_7  -  RC Behavior Guidelines</strong>&emsp;For the purposes of future elections and governing thresholds for revoking membership, RC members will be treated as staff internally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proposal 7_10  -  Player Rep Candidate Eligibility</strong>&emsp;For future RC Player Rep elections, any non-admin, non-GM may run for the spot of a normal player representative if they have played in at least one season.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proposal 9_3  -  GM dedicated rep</strong>&emsp;Starting after S9, GMs will have a dedicated representative that GMs alone will vote for. This is an additional member of RC and does not replace another spot. The election will take place no later than when player rep elections happen. This replaces S7_9 which outlines one of the player reps becoming a GM rep if no GMs are in RC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proposal 9_6  -  Player Rep Term Length</strong>&emsp;Player reps will serve for two season terms. In some cases (in order to distribute the spots up for election) certain player reps (based on placing lower in the voting than the 2 season term spots) will serve one season terms. This breakdown will be dictated before candidates are known based on RC needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proposal 9_7  -  Player Rep Amounts</strong>&emsp;There will be up to 4 player reps at a given time based on candidate amounts. In a given election/offseason, the number of candidates divided by two and rounded down will denote the maximum number of spots offered to candidates. This number will be further capped at 4 or the number of vacant player rep spots (including those at the end of their term), whichever is lower.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="voting">Voting</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Proposal 4_1  -  Voting Power</strong>&emsp;[Voting] Rules Committee members will have an equal vote except in cases of recusal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proposal 7_3  -  Admin Vetoes</strong>&emsp;If a proposal is set to pass and every admin unanimously agrees that the proposal is not in the best interest of CSC, they may issue a veto on that proposal. Following this, RC may convene and discuss with all admins to try and seek a resolution. If all admins continue to be in opposition, every other member of RC (in this case 8 members) have the ability to override the veto and pass the proposal if they so choose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proposal 7_11  -  Emergency Rule Creation</strong>&emsp;If during the middle of the season a majority of admins ask for specific rule changes, a unanimous vote by all RC members can allow for a modification to the rules without timing restrictions. This is intended to be used only under an extreme circumstance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proposal 9_1  -  Passing Threshold</strong>&emsp;At least sixty percent of active RC must vote in favor of a proposal for it to pass in addition to any other requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proposal 9_2  -  Quorum</strong>&emsp;As an additional requirement for a proposal to pass, a proposal must have been voted on by at least 75% of active RC.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="workflow">Workflow</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Proposal 7_4  -  Rules Committee Leader</strong>&emsp;Informally, RC will designate one willing person in RC to provide some structure to RC meetings and organization. This role does not hold any formal power beyond a normal vote but offers some organization and direction to help RC stay focused on its goals. They may designate members of RC to perform some housekeeping tasks to facilitate RC's functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proposal 9_4  -  RC Voting Logs</strong>&emsp;Each rule change will also have the exact members and their votes recorded and posted publicly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proposal 9_5  -  Rule In Effect Delay</strong>&emsp;By default, rules are subject to become in effect no sooner than 7 days after being formally passed. This is to give time for the community to react to new rules and for RC to be able to react and potentially pause a rule from going into effect if needed. Certain categories such as some transaction, playoff, and other rules will default to the following season if passed mid-season. RC may explicitly ignore this policy on a rule by rule basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proposal 9_8  -  RC Information Convenience</strong>&emsp;Each off-season, RC will post the prospective "to-do" list of rule changes in the discord. Additionally, each time that a new rule enters discussion in an RC thread, a discord post will also go out detailing the key information that began the discussion.</p>
</li>
