<hr />
<h2 id="31-general-guidelines">3.1  General Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>3.1.1</strong>&emsp;Please see the CSC Behavior Rules for specific behavior and conduct guidelines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>3.1.2</strong>&emsp;Please show sportsmanship within the league.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>3.1.2.1</strong>&emsp;Any concerns about the sportsmanship of other players or teams within CSC should be directed to the League Staff and your GM. Public witch-hunts of CSC teams or players is unacceptable and will be considered harassment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>3.1.2.2</strong>&emsp;Players are encouraged to take screenshots containing any insults or examples of poor sportsmanship and forward them to their GM and a member of the Moderator Committee.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>3.1.3</strong>&emsp;If at any point an individual or team feels that a rule unfairly applies to them, or has been unfairly applied to them, that individual or team should file an appeal through DMing the ModMail bot or the admins to be ruled upon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>3.1.4</strong>&emsp;Any Admin or Mod in CSC may require a player to change their name or profile picture if it is deemed to be inappropriate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&emsp;</p>
<h2 id="32-gm-behavior">3.2  GM Behavior</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>3.2.1</strong>&emsp;General Managers are expected to be trustworthy, mature, kind, and focused on helping their players and teams at all times. They should also be regularly available to their players and to staff in order to fulfill their responsibilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>3.2.2</strong>&emsp;GMs are responsible for the following: Knowing the league rules, drafting players, leading their franchise in a positive way and creating a fun environment for their players, helping and being responsive to their players as needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>3.2.3</strong>&emsp;Admins reserve the right to remove a GM at any point, without warning, if they feel that a GM is not meeting the above expectations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>3.2.4</strong>&emsp;The position of General Manager is considered a privilege, not a right, for all members of CSC who achieve the position. All GMs are reviewed following incidents of concern and after every season, if needed.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>3.2.5</strong>&emsp;A GM that contacts a contracted player from a different franchise with the intention of getting that player to join their franchise and without the player's GM's permission will be subject to punishment at admin discretion. Direct evidence of this contact/intention is required.</li>
</ul>
<p>&emsp;</p>
<h2 id="33-privileged-knowledge">3.3  Privileged Knowledge</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>3.3.1</strong>&emsp;Some members of CSC (GMs, AGMs, Staff, Admins, and certain others) may have privileged knowledge. This information falls into one of two groups.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>3.3.1.1</strong>&emsp;The first group includes player contract MMRs, the contract MMR formula, and related information, as well as certain topics indicated by Staff or Admins. Information in this group may not be shared with anyone outside of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>3.3.1.2</strong>&emsp;The second group includes transaction information for franchises, as well as certain topics indicated by Staff or Admins. Information in this group may only be shared with the permission of the appropriate individual or individuals (which could be yourself).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>3.3.2</strong>&emsp;This expectation of keeping certain knowledge secret continues even after you no longer have direct access to it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>3.3.3</strong>&emsp;Sharing this knowledge intentionally may lead to severe consequences, up to and including permanent removal from CSC.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&emsp;</p>
<h2 id="34-cheating-in-csc">3.4  Cheating in CSC</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>3.4.1</strong>&emsp;Cheating of any kind will not be tolerated in CSC and is grounds for immediate removal from the league and the discord server.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>3.4.1.1</strong>&emsp;Use of the following are not to be considered cheating for the purposes of these rules: VibranceGUI, game font changes, game config changes (.cfg files), simple radar, timer resolution, intelligent standby list cleaner. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>3.4.1.1.1</strong>&emsp;If you have something not on this list and wish to continue using it, please contact an admin for approval.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>3.4.2</strong>&emsp;Accusations of cheating must be made either through the ticket system in #roles-and-tickets, or through a DM with an admin. Cheating accusations are not to be made in public channels, and may lead to a punishment for the offender.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>3.4.3</strong>&emsp;Upon receiving a cheating accusation, the admins will assemble a committee to review the player's gameplay.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>3.4.3.1</strong>&emsp;The committee will be made of the following</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>3.4.3.1.1</strong>&emsp;Three to five highly skilled former or active CSC players.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>3.4.3.1.2</strong>&emsp;Nobody associated with the accused.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>3.4.3.2</strong>&emsp;The committee will individually review one or more demo files of the accused's gameplay as they see fit until a conclusion is reached.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>3.4.3.3</strong>&emsp;Upon completion of the demo review, a unanimous minus one vote is required to remove the player from the league</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
